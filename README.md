👋 Hi, I’m @curtmcd

I'm a retired computer engineer who worked in the fields of parallel supercomputing (IBM), operating systems (SGI, Broadcom), Ethernet switch chip development (Broadcom Strata series), device driver development (Ethernet, USB, Wi-Fi), and network storage (Pure Storage). My main programming languages are C, Python, C++, and rapidly diminishing to Haskell. I don't enjoy C++ much since it encourages code that's 90% obscure semantic fluff adding much less value than people think and resulting in huge binaries and slow programs.

👀 I’m interested in ...

- Ragtime Piano composition, typesetting and (cough) performance
- Dual sport motorcycling, and touring
- 3D Printing
- Bicycling, running (my left medial meniscus begs to differ)
- Armchair math, physics, science

🌱 I’m currently learning ...

- OpenSCAD and its internals
- Other varieties of CAD software
- Additive manufacturing fundamentals

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Anything you see here or on my web site.
